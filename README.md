## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

#### Backend
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless edge computing platform for the API
- **Durable Objects**: Stateful serverless computing for persistent game rooms
- **WebSockets**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **SQLite**: Game state persistence (via Durable Objects)
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development

#### Frontend
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Canvas API**: High-performance game board rendering
- **WebSockets**: Real-time updates from the server

### Why Durable Objects?

Durable Objects were chosen as the core technology for this virtual tabletop application due to their unique WebSocket handling capabilities and cost optimization features:

#### WebSocket Hibernation
Unlike traditional WebSocket servers that must remain in memory to maintain connections, Durable Objects support **WebSocket Hibernation** - a Cloudflare-specific feature that allows WebSocket connections to remain active even when the Durable Object is evicted from memory during periods of inactivity.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Cost Optimization**: No billable duration (GB-seconds) charges during idle periods
- **Scalability**: Single Durable Object instance can handle thousands of WebSocket connections
- **Automatic Recovery**: When a message arrives, the Durable Object is automatically recreated and the message is delivered to the appropriate handler
- **Persistent Connections**: Clients stay connected even when the server-side object is hibernated

#### Single-Point Coordination
Durable Objects provide a single point of coordination between multiple clients, making them ideal for:
- **Multiplayer Game State**: All players in a game room share the same Durable Object instance
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Game state updates are broadcast to all connected players
- **State Persistence**: Game state is automatically saved and survives object hibernation

#### Architecture Comparison

| Feature | Traditional WebSocket Server | Durable Objects |
|---------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Memory Usage | Always in memory | Hibernates when idle |
| Cost Model | Pay for idle time | Pay only when active |
| Scalability | Limited by memory | Thousands of connections per instance |
| State Management | Requires external storage | Built-in persistence |
| Recovery | Manual reconnection logic | Automatic message delivery |

This architecture enables the virtual tabletop to support multiple concurrent game rooms with minimal infrastructure costs while maintaining real-time responsiveness for all players.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: WebSocket-based synchronization across all players
- **Persistent Game State**: Automatic saving via Durable Objects
- **Interactive Canvas**: Drag-and-drop token management with grid-based movement
- **Token Management**: Create, move, and customize tokens with properties
- **Dice Rolling**: Multiple dice types with visual feedback (`/roll 2d6+3`)
- **Chat System**: Real-time messaging with dice roll integration
- **Player Management**: Join/leave notifications, player list, and permissions
- **Room Management**: Create and join game rooms with optional passwords

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Automated accessibility testing with axe-core

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.0.0 or higher (required for WebSocket API support)
- pnpm 8.0.0 or higher (enforced)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
# API runs on http://localhost:8787
# Website runs on http://localhost:5173

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Format and lint code
pnpm format-and-lint
```

### Development Tools

- **Biome**: Fast formatter and linter for TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Vitest**: Unit testing framework with native TypeScript support
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing for accessibility and functionality
- **Lighthouse CI**: Performance testing and monitoring
- **Turbo**: Build system orchestration for the monorepo
- **Wrangler**: Cloudflare Workers CLI for local development

### Environment Variables

#### API (`api/wrangler.jsonc`)
- `FRONTEND_URL`: Allowed origin for CORS (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Environment name (`development`, `staging`, `production`)
- `CREATE_ROOM_API_KEY`: API key required for room creation

#### Website
- No environment variables required for local development
- Production deployment handled via Cloudflare Pages

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- **API Key Authentication**: Room creation requires a valid API key via `X-API-Key` header
- **Password-Protected Rooms**: Optional password protection for game sessions
- **Player Identification**: Unique player IDs generated per session

### Rate Limiting

Multiple levels of rate limiting protect against abuse:

| Endpoint | Limit | Window | Identifier |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| Room Creation | 5 | 1 hour | IP Address |
| WebSocket Connections | 10 | 1 minute | IP Address |
| Room State Requests | 30 | 1 minute | IP + Room ID |

### Security Headers

All API responses include comprehensive security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' wss: https:`

### Input Validation
- Sanitization of user inputs (chat messages, player names)
- URL validation for external links
- Maximum length enforcement
- HTML tag stripping
- JavaScript URL prevention
